### Resources:
- Generalize Resource System
- Add multiple resources with multiple steps

### Buildings:
- Generalize Building System
- Add multiple Buildings

### Energy:
- Add an Energy System

### Parcels:
- Add Resource Storage Limits
- Add Parcel Specific Resource Deposits

### Long Term:
- Blueprints
    - Does it make sense to include blueprints?
- Scaling production
    - Continent System: Build a boat to access new continents?
    - Planet System: After a rocket is launched, the player can choose a new planet. This opens up the gate for interplanetary logistics
    - Galaxy System: Harness the Energy of the Sun to build a dyson sphere and then build an intergalactic spaceship. Opens up intergalactic logistics (wormhole or will time play a role?)


Random Resources per Parcel generation:
- Issue: Full Parcel Blueprints will become harder to use. Also full planet scale blueprinting will become harder.
- Solutions:
    - Scanners: Allow searching for specific parcels, determining the next parcels composition
    - Terraforming: Allow changing parcel resource deposits
    - Nanobots: Allow changing parcel resource deposits
    - Simple Resource Deposits: Just make them "Rich", "Medium", "Traces" --> makes blueprints easier
    - Never have blueprints --> Scaling becomes harder

Roadmap:
- Add ironOre to ironPlate production
    - Needs another building



I changed ironPlates to be ironOre.
As a next step I want to introduce the mechanic of transforming one resource into another.
So a building can have one or multiple inputs of resources & outputs another resource at a given rate.
The first example of this will be iron smelting. For this we will have two new buildings called "Iron Smelter" & "Coal Miner".
The Coal Miner works just as the Iron Miner, but outputs coal.
The Iron Smelter takes as an Input 4 Iron Ore & 1 Coal to output 2 Iron Plates.

Please think about the changes that need to be made to the codebase. Don't write the full code yet, but let me know about all the changes needed.
Include any changes in terms of depencies that change.
Also, think about how to generalize functions to accomodate multiple resources, multiple buildings so that adding in new buildings and resources afterwards becomes easier.
