### The ability to scale production rates on a:
- Global Level
- Building Specific Level
    buildingManager.updateBuildingProductionRateModifier('kiln', 0.5); // Increase Kiln production rate by 50%
    buildingManager.updateBuildingConsumptionRateModifier('ironSmelter', -0.3); // Decrease Iron Smelter consumption rate by 30%
- Parcel Level
- Building in Parcel Level

### Energy:
- Add an Energy System
    - If energy low: reduce prodction & consumption rate equally (slowing down)
    - Allow for overcharge system:
    reward more energy in the system by allowing for overcharging.
    This increases both rates (speeding up) but it gets diminishing returns.
    - Energy is a global variable ->

### Pollutin / Military?

### Beacon System

### Long Term:
- Blueprints
    - Does it make sense to include blueprints?
- Scaling production
    - Continent System: Build a boat to access new continents?
    - Planet System: After a rocket is launched, the player can choose a new planet. This opens up the gate for interplanetary logistics
    - Galaxy System: Harness the Energy of the Sun to build a dyson sphere and then build an intergalactic spaceship. Opens up intergalactic logistics (wormhole or will time play a role?)


Random Resources per Parcel generation:
- Issue: Full Parcel Blueprints will become harder to use. Also full planet scale blueprinting will become harder.
- Solutions:
    - Scanners: Allow searching for specific parcels, determining the next parcels composition
    - Terraforming: Allow changing parcel resource deposits
    - Nanobots: Allow changing parcel resource deposits
    - Simple Resource Deposits: Just make them "Rich", "Medium", "Traces" --> makes blueprints easier
    - Never have blueprints --> Scaling becomes harder
